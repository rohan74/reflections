How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It is more easier to find the bug and help in typos which might be unintentional.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to history help in tracking all the changes made in program and therefore help in understanding the code better. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    By manually creating a commit we know what kind of changes are made in the commit and history is not cultterd. By automatically saving the changes, we will be unable to track the changes in a logical fashion. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    ususally Docs are independent in nature, do not require multiple tracking. In git each file is dependent on each other in some form, hence tracking all of them at once is a good idea.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   log help to see all the commit made in the program, and diff compare two commit and help in checking the changes made in two commit 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    By using git i help a lot get back to previous state and start deugging stuff from then.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    do more practice to get familar with Git
